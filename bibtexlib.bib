   abstract = {Abstract QIIME 2 is a completely re-engineered microbiome bioinformatics platform based on the popular QIIME platform, which it has replaced. QIIME 2 facilitates comprehensive and fully reproducible microbiome data science, improving accessibility to diverse users by adding multiple user interfaces. QIIME 2 can be combined with Qiita, an open-source web-based platform, to re-use available data for meta-analysis. The following basic protocol describes how to install QIIME 2 on a single computer and analyze microbiome sequence data, from processing of raw DNA sequence reads through generating publishable interactive figures. These interactive figures allow readers of a study to interact with data with the same ease as its authors, advancing microbiome science transparency and reproducibility. We also show how plug-ins developed by the community to add analysis capabilities can be installed and used with QIIME 2, enhancing various aspects of microbiome analyses?e.g., improving taxonomic classification accuracy. Finally, we illustrate how users can perform meta-analyses combining different datasets using readily available public data through Qiita. In this tutorial, we analyze a subset of the Early Childhood Antibiotics and the Microbiome (ECAM) study, which tracked the microbiome composition and development of 43 infants in the United States from birth to 2 years of age, identifying microbiome associations with antibiotic exposure, delivery mode, and diet.

   abstract = {Summary The nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region is the primary choice for molecular identification of fungi. Its two highly variable spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) are usually species specific, whereas the intercalary 5.8S gene is highly conserved. For sequence clustering and blast searches, it is often advantageous to rely on either one of the variable spacers but not the conserved 5.8S gene. To identify and extract ITS1 and ITS2 from large taxonomic and environmental data sets is, however, often difficult, and many ITS sequences are incorrectly delimited in the public sequence databases. We introduce ITSx, a Perl-based software tool to extract ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2 ? as well as full-length ITS sequences ? from both Sanger and high-throughput sequencing data sets. ITSx uses hidden Markov models computed from large alignments of a total of 20 groups of eukaryotes, including fungi, metazoans and plants, and the sequence extraction is based on the predicted positions of the ribosomal genes in the sequences. ITSx has a very high proportion of true-positive extractions and a low proportion of false-positive extractions. Additionally, process parallelization permits expedient analyses of very large data sets, such as a one million sequence amplicon pyrosequencing data set. ITSx is rich in features and written to be easily incorporated into automated sequence analysis pipelines. ITSx paves the way for more sensitive blast searches and sequence clustering operations for the ITS region in eukaryotes. The software also permits elimination of non-ITS sequences from any data set. This is particularly useful for amplicon-based next-generation sequencing data sets, where insidious non-target sequences are often found among the target sequences. Such non-target sequences are difficult to find by other means and would contribute noise to diversity estimates if left in the data set.},

   abstract = {Abstract In the face of evolving agricultural practices and climate change, tools towards an integrated biovigilance platform to combat crop diseases, spore sampling, DNA diagnostics and predictive trajectory modelling were optimized. These tools revealed microbial dynamics and were validated by monitoring cereal rust fungal pathogens affecting wheat, oats, barley and rye across four growing seasons (2015?2018) in British Columbia and during the 2018 season in southern Alberta. ITS2 metabarcoding revealed disparity in aeromycobiota diversity and compositional structure across the Canadian Rocky Mountains, suggesting a barrier effect on air flow and pathogen dispersal. A novel bioinformatics classifier and curated cereal rust fungal ITS2 database, corroborated by real-time PCR, enhanced the precision of cereal rust fungal species identification. Random Forest modelling identified crop and land-use diversification as well as atmospheric pressure and moisture as key factors in rust distribution. As a valuable addition to explain observed differences and patterns in rust fungus distribution, trajectory HYSPLIT modelling tracked rust fungal urediniospores' northeastward dispersal from the Pacific Northwest towards southern British Columbia and Alberta, indicating multiple potential origins. Our Canadian case study exemplifies the power of an advanced biovigilance toolbox towards developing an early-warning system for farmers to detect and mitigate impending disease outbreaks.},

   abstract = {The dispersion of fungal inocula such as the airborne spores of rust fungi (Pucciniales) can be monitored through metabarcoding of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) of the rRNA gene in environmental DNAs. This method is largely dependent on a high-quality reference database (refDB) and primers with proper taxonomic coverage and specificity. For this study, a curated ITS2 reference database (named CR-ITS2-refDB) comprising representatives of the major cereal rust fungi and phylogenetically related species was compiled. Interspecific and intraspecific variation analyses suggested that the ITS2 region had reasonable discriminating power for the majority of the Puccinia species or species complexes in the database. In silico evaluation of nine forward and seven reverse ITS2 primers, including three newly designed, revealed marked variation in DNA amplification efficiency for the rusts. We validated the theoretical assessment of rust-enhanced (Rust2inv/ITS4var_H) and universal fungal (ITS9F/ITS4) ITS2 primer pairs by profiling the airborne rust fungal communities from environmental samples via a metabarcoding approach. Species- or subspecies-level identification of the rusts was improved by use of CR-ITS2-refDB and the Automated Oligonucleotide Design Pipeline (AODP), which identified all mutations distinguishing highly conserved DNA markers between close relatives. A generic bioinformatics pipeline was developed, including all steps used in this study from in silico evaluation of primers to accurate identification of short metabarcodes at the level of interest for defining phytopathogens. The results highlight the importance of primer selection, refDBs that are resolved to reflect phylogenetic relationships, and the use of AODP for improving the reliability of metabarcoding in phytopathogen biosurveillance.},

   abstract = {Abstract Canada is one of the largest wheat producers in the world, and wheat is grown over an area spanning most of the southern latitudes, with the prairie region (provinces of Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Manitoba) being the main producer. Several pathogens and pests attack wheat, but at present fusarium head blight (FHB), stripe rust, and leaf spots are the most damaging diseases to wheat production in Canada. Historically, smuts, stem rust, and leaf rust caused major crop losses in Canada and can still pose serious threat if management practices are relaxed. Cropping practices used by Canadian farmers to grow and harvest wheat over the last century have influenced disease development and pathogen biology, affecting the severity, incidence, and prevalence of crop diseases over time. Changes such as reduced tillage coincide with emergence of residue-borne diseases, such as FHB and leaf spots, while the deployment of resistant cultivars and increased fungicide use has resulted in the reduction of common bunt, stem, and leaf rust. This review will discuss the influence of long-term cropping practices, alone or in combination, on the biology, emergence, and prevalence of wheat diseases in Canada over the last century.},

   abstract = {Wheat (Triticum spp.) is a major field crop in Canada in terms of acreage, annual production, and export market value. There are nine classes of Canadian wheat based on growth habit (winter or spring), kernel hardness (hard or soft), seed coat color (red or white), and quality factors (grain protein content and gluten strength). Wheat was described by Newman in 1928 as “the economic fairy to the industrial and commercial life of Canada, having built practically the whole economic structure of the Prairie Provinces.” Wheat production in Canada is affected by several biotic and abiotic stresses. The major abiotic stresses are frost damage, drought, and heat stress. Among biotic stresses, diseases caused by fungal pathogens are the most important although wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) has caused some localized outbreaks in some years. In context of cultivar registration in Canada, there are certain diseases that breeders have to take into account while developing resistant cultivars. The Prairie Recommending Committee for Wheat, Rye, and Triticale (PRCWRT) classify wheat diseases into priority one, priority two, and priority three depending on prevalence and potential damage they can cause. However, priority one diseases are more of a concern and a minimum level of resistance in commercial cultivars is recommended for those.},
