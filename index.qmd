## Special Notification

This workshop offers hands-on training in in silico methods for the identification and classification of organisms from sequencing data, with a focus on rust fungus-infected cereal samples collected from the field. While examples will be drawn from cereal rust fungi, the underlying concepts and workflows are broadly applicable and can be adapted to other target species of interest.

The workshop is designed for participants who are already comfortable using command-line tools and the Linux operating system. It is not intended for beginners seeking introductory Linux training. Participants are expected to bring their own laptops with either a Linux virtual machine (installed via VirtualBox) or access to a Linux-based high-performance computing (HPC) server. Detailed setup instructions will be provided to all registrants in advance, and the required computing environment must be prepared prior to the workshop.
